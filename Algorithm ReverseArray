Algorithm:
Initialize two pointers, start and end, which point to the first and last elements of the array, respectively.
Swap the elements at start and end.
Move the start pointer forward (i.e., start++) and the end pointer backward (i.e., end--).
Repeat this process until start becomes greater than or equal to end.
The array will be reversed after the loop.
